# BabyLog

A FitBit Smartwatch app to track in a very simplistic way when your baby slept or ate the last time

![Versa](/resources/Screenshots/Screenshot_Versa.png)

The display shows several data:
- the last time you logged a baby feed time
- the elapsed time since the last logged feed
- the last time the baby started a sleep
- the last time the baby ended a sleep
- the elapsed time since the baby started or ended a sleep depending if it is currently still sleeping

The data is stored on your smartwatch.

You can log a feed by the upper right combo button.
You can start / end a sleep log by the lower right combo button.

**Only the last feed / sleep is logged. Older data is overwritten.**
